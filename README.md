# AI-driven highlights extraction from live steams
# - StreamClipper AI -

This repository contains a web app for auto highlights generation for a twitch stream live with ai!
We utilize the power of ai (PANNs and Hugging Faces) to extract features from sound and live chat to predict highlights from video game streams on twitch! <br>

To run the web app and the server follow the instructions below.

## Features
* Upload and manage your own stream videos
* Record live streams directly live from Twitch (via FFmpeg and streamlink)
* Import Twitch VODs directly from Twitch (including chat logs)
* Audio analysis using panns-inference / librosa
* Chat analysis using Huggingface sentiment models
* Generation of highligh clips based on weighted scoring
