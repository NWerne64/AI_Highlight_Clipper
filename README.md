# - StreamClipper AI -

This repository contains a web app for auto highlights generation for a twitch stream live with ai!
We utilize the power of ai (PANNs and Hugging Faces) to extract features from sound and live chat to predict highlights from video game streams on twitch! <br>

To run the web app and the server follow the instructions below.

## Instructions

You need to do the following to use the app:


1. Using the `pip install â€“r requirements.txt` command, install all the necessary libraries for the web application to work
2. Using the `python manage.py makemigrations`
3. Using the `python manage.py migrate`
4. Set up config for the twitch integration, for this open the file `.env` and enter the following data

5. Install mendatory PANNs data: "Cnn14_mAP=0.431", through this [link](https://huggingface.co/thelou1s/panns-inference/blob/main/Cnn14_mAP%3D0.431.pth) *(warning: 327mb)*
6. Move the "Cnn14_mAP=0.431" to `panns_data`
7. Now we can launch the web application. To launch the web application in the root directory of the repository, enter the command:`python manage.py runserver`
